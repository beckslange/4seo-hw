      <h2>What Is a Croissant?</h2>
      <p>
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, crescent-shaped pastry that belongs to
        the category of <strong>viennoiserie</strong>, a French term for baked
        goods enriched with butter, eggs, and milk.
      </p>

      <p>
        Made from yeast-leavened dough that is laminated with layers of butter,
        croissants are known for their crisp exterior and soft, honeycomb-like
        interior. Though inspired by the Austrian kipferl, the croissant was
        perfected using classic French baking techniques.
