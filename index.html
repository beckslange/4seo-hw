    <h1>🥐 The Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, crescent-shaped pastry that belongs to
      the category of viennoiserie, a French term for baked goods enriched with
      ingredients like butter, eggs, and milk, bridging the gap between bread
      and pastry. Made from a yeast-leavened dough that is laminated (layered
      with butter) multiple times, croissants have a rich flavor and a
      distinctive honeycomb interior, inspired by the Austrian kipferl but
      perfected with French techniques.
